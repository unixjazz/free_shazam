freezam 0.4
-----------
This is an implementation of the fast audio identification algorithm designed by Shazam.
We use an approximate technique, but only use FOSS libraries and tools to get the work 
done. What you should know is that this is a mere PoC developed at Mark Hensen's stats 
class at UCLA. If you want the secret sauce, talk to the folks at Shazam.

entertainment purposes. **


How does it work 
----------------
Shazam is composed by a set of tools for spectrogram analysis, fingerprinting, 
storage, and fast retrieval. Here we do not deal with the storage and retrieval part,
only with the preparation of the files and the technique of identification. The file
'PoC_shazam.R' is commented and is self-explanatory.

There are a few steps to take:
0. Transform music spectrograms into matrices
1. Analyze matrices, storing its 'fingerprint' and generating unique hash numbers
2. Use stored fingerprints and use them for music identification


Requirements
------------
Before you install, make sure you have met the dependencies:

- Gstreamer 1.0 and its plugins (for the 'good' set)
- R-base
- "Sound" and "signal" packages for R
